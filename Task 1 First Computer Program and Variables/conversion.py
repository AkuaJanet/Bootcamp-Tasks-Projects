This pseudocode is for the quicker version. 
1. create a variable called "num1" and assign it the value 99.23
2. create a variable called "num2" and assign it the value 23
3. create a variable called "num3" and assign it the value 150
4. create a variable called "string1" and assign it the value "100"
5. output num1 as an integer
6. output num2 as a float
7. output num3 as a string
8. output string1 as an integer
End
